# Hi, I'm JJ Loftus 👋

I'm a third-year Electrical Engineering student and AFROTC cadet at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

In my free time, I enjoy drawing, lifting, reading, hiking, and petting my cat!

Feel free to send me an email at **jjloftus05@outlook.com** if you’d like to reach out. Thank you!
