# Hi, I'm JJ Loftus 👋

I'm a first-year Electrical Engineering student and an AFROTC cadet at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

In my free time, I enjoy drawing, petting my cat, and playing basketball ⛹️.

Feel free to send me an email at **jjloftus05@outlook.com** if you’d like to reach out. Thank you!
